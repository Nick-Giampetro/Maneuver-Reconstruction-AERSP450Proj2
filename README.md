Project by Nicholas Giampetro and Grace Savage

Originally completed for AERSP 450 on 11/12/2023, this repository serves to archive this project for myself and my colleagues who worked on it.

MATLAB program that utilizes Gauss's and Gibb's methods combine with analytical techniques to recreate orbits based of the provided data and determine the delta-v required to execute the series of orbit changes to go from each unique orbit to the next.
